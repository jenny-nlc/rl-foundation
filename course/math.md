## gradient
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient
  * the gradient is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative. 
  * While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable, 
    for functions of several variables, the gradient takes its place. 
  * The gradient is a vector-valued function, as opposed to a derivative, which is scalar-valued.
