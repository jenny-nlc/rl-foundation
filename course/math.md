## gradient
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient
  * the gradient is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative.
  * While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable,
    for functions of several variables, the gradient takes its place.
  * The gradient is a vector-valued function, as opposed to a derivative, which is scalar-valued.

  * grad of differentiable fn is a vector of partial derivative of f

## logit
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit
  * If `p` is a probability, then `p/(1 âˆ’ p)` is the corresponding odds;
  * the logit of the probability is the logarithm of the odds.
  * `logit(p) = log[p/(1-p)]
