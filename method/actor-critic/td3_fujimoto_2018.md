## problem
* function approximation
errors are known to lead to overestimated value
estimates and suboptimal policies

## idea
* takes
the minimum value between a pair of critics to re-
strict overestimation and delays policy updates to
reduce per-update error
* a novel clipped variant of Double Q-learning for actor-critic methods.
