# dim2: model-free, model-based, ...

## model-free
### pros
* have the advantage of handling arbitrary dynamical systems with minimal bias

### cons
 * less sample-efficient, high sample complexity

### methods
?

## model-based
### pros
* sample-efficient

### cons
* suffer from significant bias, since complex unknown dy- namics cannot always be modeled accurately enough to

### method: model learning
