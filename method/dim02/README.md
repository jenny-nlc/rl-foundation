# dim2: model-free, model-based, ...

## model-free
* pros
  * have the advantage of handling arbitrary dynamical systems with minimal bias
* cons
  * less sample-efficient
* methods

## model-based
### pros
* sample-efficient

### cons
* suffer from significant bias, since complex unknown dy- namics cannot always be modeled accurately enough to
