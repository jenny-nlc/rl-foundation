## keys
* sensitivity analysis
  * study on how changes in model affects the output (i.e `V` and `\phi^*`)
  * study the stability or robustness of an optimal solution
* although the value of `V` is sensitive to changes in the model parameters,
  their impact on `\phi^*` is not as apparent
  * in fact, the optimal policy is often **robust to minor deviations** in the model parameters
* for future work
  * problems where params are allowed to change simultaneously,
    now: solely in reward or transition
    
## comment
* this consider changes on `\gamma` as working example
* sensitivity analysis wrt model-error has been extensively studied in Operation Research,
  specifically Dynamics Prog and Linear Prog
