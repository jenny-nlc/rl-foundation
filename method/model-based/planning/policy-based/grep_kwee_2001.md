# Gradient-based Reinforcement Planning in Policy-Search Methods

## idea: GREP
* GREP is a gradient-based method that
   * plans ahead and
   * improves its policy before it actually acts in the environment.
* derive the formulas for the exact policy gradient and confirm our ideas in numerical experiments

## setup
* for discrete problem.

## result
* Numerical experiments suggest that
  the probabilistic policy indeed converges to an optimal policyâ€”but quite slowly
