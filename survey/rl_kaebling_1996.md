The model consists of knowledge of
the state transition probability function $T(s,a,s')$ and
the reinforcement function $R(s,a)$.

Model-free: Learn a controller without learning a model.
Model-based: Learn a model, and use it to derive a controller.
Similarly in adaptive control: direct and indirect adaptive control.
