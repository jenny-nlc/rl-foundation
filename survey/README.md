> Just as reinforcement learning present took a step away from the ultimate goal of reward to
> focus on value functions, so reinforcement learning future may take a further step
> away to focus on the structures that enable value function estimation [...] In psy-
> chology, the idea of a developing mind actively creating its representations of the
> world is called constructivism. My prediction is that for the next tens of years rein-
> forcement learning will be focused on constructivism
