* Model predictive control
  * is model-based, not adaptive,and has a high online complexity, 
  * but also has a mature stability, feasibility and robustness theory as well as an in-herent constraint handling

* Reinforcement learning 
  * is model-free, is adaptive, and has a low online complexity, 
  * but also has an immature stability,feasibility and robustness theory as well as a diﬃcult con-straint handling. 

* the notion of stability is **diﬀerent** 
  (a uniﬁed stability and robustness theory isnot available yet)
  * control systems:
    * concentrates on stability of the closed-loop system
  * computational intelligence:
    * focuses on stability, or more precisely convergence,of the learning algorithm.
    * Stability of the closed-loop system is essentially addressed with certainty equivalence
