## problem
* Applying end-to-end learning to solve complex, interactive, pixel-driven control tasks on a robot
* Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms are too slow to achieve performance on a real robot, but 
  their potential has been demonstrated in simulated environments
  
## idea: progressive networks


## result
* rather than relying on model-based trajectory optimisation, the task learning is
  accomplished using only deep reinforcement learning and sparse rewards.
