Suton: <br />
"Just as reinforcement learning present took a step away from the ultimate goal of reward to
focus on value functions, so reinforcement learning future may take a further step
away to focus on the structures that enable value function estimation [...] In psy-
chology, the idea of a developing mind actively creating its representations of the
world is called constructivism. My prediction is that for the next tens of years rein-
forcement learning will be focused on constructivism."
