## (Rough) dimensions of challenges:
* (onlinePlanning or modelFreeRL) _to_ (onlinePlanning + modelLearning + modelFreeRL)
* MDP (fully observable states) _to_ POMDP (partially observable states) model/formulations
* discrete (small) _to_ continuous (large numbers of) states, actions, observations
* stationary (fixed) _to_ non-stationary (changing) models
* short _to_ long planning horizon
* simulated (kinematic) _to_ real (dynamic,physics-intensive) evaluation/robot/world
* noObstacle _to_ fullObstacle (clutter) workspace
* single _to_ multi agents
* single _to_ multi (similar but not same) tasks
* plain _to_ hierarchical (multi-level) structure
* discrete _to_ continuous time
* low _to_ high dof robots
