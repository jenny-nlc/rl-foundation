### Topics in RL:
* Bayesian RL
* Transfer learning in RL
* Hierarchical RL
* Inverse RL (imitation/apprenticeship learning)
* Multiagent RL

### Note:
Sutton: <br />
"Just as reinforcement learning present took a step away from the ultimate goal of reward to
focus on value functions, so reinforcement learning future may take a further step
away to focus on the structures that enable value function estimation [...] In psy-
chology, the idea of a developing mind actively creating its representations of the
world is called constructivism. My prediction is that for the next tens of years rein-
forcement learning will be focused on constructivism."

Marco Wiering, Martijn van Otterlo: <br/>
Two dominant books: 
* Introduction to reinforcement learning by Rich Sutton and Andy Barto from 1998. 
  From an artificial intelligence perspective.
* Neuro-dynamic programming by Dimitri Bertsekas and John Tsitsiklis in 1996.
  From the standpoint of operations research.
