## (Rough) dimensions of challenges:
* MDP (fully observable states) _...to..._ POMDP (partially observable states) model/formulations
* discrete (small) _...to..._ continuous (large numbers of) states, actions, observations
* stationary (fixed) _...to..._ non-stationary (changing) models
* short _...to..._ long planning horizon
* simulated (kinematic) _...to..._ real (dynamic,physics-intensive) evaluation/robot/world
* noObstacle _...to..._ fullObstacle (clutter) workspace
* single _...to..._ multi agents
* single _...to..._ multi (similar but not same) tasks
* low _...to..._ high dof robots
* discrete _...to..._ continuous time (discretization time-step decreases to 0)
