## (Rough) dimensions of challenges (problems):
* onlinePlanning, modelFreeRL _to_ (onlinePlanning + modelLearning + modelFreeRL)
* MDP (fully observable states) _to_ POMDP (partially observable states) model/formulations
* discrete (small) _to_ continuous (large numbers of) states, actions, observations
* stationary (fixed) _to_ non-stationary (changing) models
* short _to_ long planning horizon
* simulated _to_ real robots/world
* noObstacle _to_ fullObstacle (clutter) workspace
* shallow _to_ deep learning
* without-prior (non-Bayesian) _to_ with-prior (Bayesian)
* kinematic _to_ dynamic (physics-intensive) environments
* single _to_ multi agents
* single _to_ multi (similar but not same) tasks
* plain _to_ hierarchical (multi-level) structure
* discrete _to_ continuous time
* low _to_ high cumulative rewards
* on low _to_ high dof robots
* long _to_ short planning time (hard realtime constrainst)
