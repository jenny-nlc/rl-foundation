* tiger~\cite{Pack1998}:
Imagine an agent standing in front of two closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a tiger
and behind the other is a large reward. If the agent opens the door with the tiger, then a
large penalty is received (presumably in the form of some amount of bodily injury). Instead
of opening one of the two doors, the agent can listen, in order to gain some information
about the location of the tiger. Unfortunately, listening is not free; in addition, it is also
not entirely accurate. There is a chance that the agent will hear a tiger behind the left-hand
door when the tiger is really behind the right-hand door, and vice versa.
